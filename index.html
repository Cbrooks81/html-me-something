               <h1>The Tailgate</h1>
           </header>
               <p>Kansas City weathermen had spent the entire week leading up to
                  the chiefs game prediciting an ice storm for the ages.  My friends
                  and I decided that for a home playoff game we were going to tailgate no matter.
                  We werent the only fans to go this route.  At 2pm there were lines of cars waiting
                  for the gates to open to get in and get setup.  This was 5.5 hours before any football
                  was to be played.  By 4 o'clock the lots were full.  Everyone had their tents up, grills
                  going, and favorite pregame beverages in hand. 32 degrees and rain did nothing to calm
                  the excitement of the Chiefs fans!  We ate food, met our neighbors, and played games until 7
                  o'clock rolled around and it was time to get into our seats.</p>

               <p>The game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Kansas City Chiefs starts and the Arrowhead
                  crowd is noisy and electric from this moment on until the end.</p>
               <p>The first quarter is back and forth.  The Steelers opening drives ends in them getting a field goal.
                  The Chiefs answer immediately with a touchdown to take a 7-3 lead.  On the next Steelers possessiom
                  another field goal.  The Chiefs offense however stalled and was forced to punt back to the Steelers.
               <h1>End of 1...Score: 7-6 Chiefs</h1>

               <p>The second quarter does not go so well for the Chiefs.  The Chiefs defense gets an interception but
                 the offense gives an interception, a fumble, and a punt back to Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh takes these
                 opportunitites and successfully makes two more field goals.</p>
               <h1>Halftime... Score: 12-6 Steelers</h1>

               <p>The third quarter goes by without much action.  Each team scored one field goal.  Other than that there
                 were just punts back and forth.  In hindsight this would have been a good quarter to wait in the concessions
                 line!</p>
               <h1>End of 3... Score: 15-10 Steelers</h1>

           </header>
               <p>The forth quarter opens with the Steelers kicking thier sixth and final field goal of the game.
                 The Chiefs would then put a big drive together in front of the home fans and score a touchdown with less
                 3 minutes to play.  The score was now 18-16 and kicking the extra point was of no use
                 so the decision was made to go for 2pts.  Tension was high in the stadium as Alex Smith found
                 tight end Demetrius Harris in the end zone.  Celebrations broke out on the field and in the stands we all
                 thought the game was tied.  A yellow flag was laying on the field though indicating a penalty.
                 The referee anounced a holding on the Chiefs which resulted in the ball getting moved further away from
                 the end zone and the playing having to be ran again.  The Chiefs next attempt was unsuccessful.
                 The situation looked bad but we still had a chance if the defense could stop the Steelers.  They could not,
                 Steelers got the first down and were able to run out the clock.</p>
               <h1> End of Game... Score: 18-16 Steelers<h1>
       </article>
           <p>The fans fell silent and began their exit from stadium.  The 2016-2017 Nfl season had come to a heartbreaking end
             for the Chiefs and their fans</p>
